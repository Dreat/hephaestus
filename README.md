To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/config`](http://localhost:4000/config) from your browser.

Upload json file (requires only `"type":` field specified on each section). All other fields are optional. Right now `id` field is discouraged.

Then you can edit existing sections and add/delete them.

Once you're happy fill filename and download a file - enjoy your new json config file!
